  Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and
  context. That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories**
  to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

  Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar. View their code in the
  `src/stories` directory to learn how they work. We recommend building UIs with a
  [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and
  ending with pages.
